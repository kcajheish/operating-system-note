# operating-system-note

These notes are taken from the textbook, [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).

A lots of design in os can applied elsewhere, and the underlying thesis is this: how system leverage hardwares to achieve best performance while user interacts with system in a safe way. I definitely recommend this to any software engineer for a read.
