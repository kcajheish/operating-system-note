# operating-system-note

These notes are taken from the textbook, [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).

A lot of design in OS can be applied elsewhere, and the underlying thesis is this: how the system leverages hardwares to achieve best performance while user interacts with the system in a safe way. I recommend this book to any software engineer.
